# MobileCLI Security Audit Checklist

**Last Updated:** January 19, 2026
**Status:** MUST COMPLETE BEFORE PUBLIC RELEASE

---

## CRITICAL: Why This Matters

MobileCLI is intentionally built with extensive permissions (79 total). This makes it powerful but also means:

1. **Users trust us with significant device access**
2. **Any embedded personal data could be exposed**
3. **The app could be reverse-engineered**
4. **APK contents are not secret**

---

## Pre-Release Security Checklist

### 1. Personal Data Removal

#### 1.1 Search for Personal Information
```bash
# Run these searches in the MobileCLI-CLEAN directory
grep -r "slodo" .
grep -r "@gmail.com" .
grep -r "@outlook.com" .
grep -r "C:\\Users\\" .
grep -r "/Users/" .
grep -r "phone number" .
grep -r "address" .
```

#### 1.2 Check for Hardcoded Paths
- [ ] No absolute Windows paths (`C:\Users\slodo\...`)
- [ ] No absolute Unix paths with usernames
- [ ] All paths use relative references or environment variables

#### 1.3 Remove Debug Information
- [ ] No personal debug logs
- [ ] No test phone numbers
- [ ] No test email addresses
- [ ] No personal API keys

### 2. Conversation/Chat History

#### 2.1 AI Conversation Logs
- [ ] No Claude conversation history in code
- [ ] No Gemini conversation history
- [ ] No ChatGPT/Codex conversation history
- [ ] No conversation references in comments

#### 2.2 Development Notes
- [ ] No personal TODOs with identifying info
- [ ] No "Rob" or personal name references
- [ ] No references to personal projects

### 3. API Keys & Secrets

#### 3.1 What SHOULD Be Public (OK to commit)
- Supabase Anon Key (designed to be public)
- Stripe Publishable Key (designed to be public)
- Firebase config (non-sensitive parts)

#### 3.2 What MUST NOT Be Public (NEVER commit)
- [ ] Supabase Service Key
- [ ] Stripe Secret Key
- [ ] Stripe Webhook Signing Secret
- [ ] OAuth Client Secrets
- [ ] Signing Keystore Password
- [ ] Any database passwords

#### 3.3 Check .gitignore
Ensure these are ignored:
```
*.keystore
*.jks
local.properties
.env
.env.local
secrets.json
service-account.json
```

### 4. Git History Audit

#### 4.1 Check for Sensitive Commits
```bash
# Search git history for sensitive patterns
git log --all --full-history -p | grep -i "password"
git log --all --full-history -p | grep -i "secret"
git log --all --full-history -p | grep -i "api_key"
git log --all --full-history -p | grep -i "@gmail"
```

#### 4.2 Options if Sensitive Data Found
1. **Clean history** (complex):
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch PATH_TO_FILE" \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

2. **Start fresh** (simpler):
   - Create new repo
   - Copy current clean files
   - Push as initial commit

### 5. APK Security

#### 5.1 What's Visible in APK
Anyone can extract and view:
- All Kotlin/Java code (decompiled)
- All resource files
- All string values
- AndroidManifest.xml
- All assets

#### 5.2 ProGuard/R8 Obfuscation
- [ ] Enable minification for release builds
- [ ] Configure ProGuard rules
- [ ] Test release APK works after obfuscation

#### 5.3 Release Build Config
```gradle
buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled true
        shrinkResources true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
    }
}
```

### 6. Network Security

#### 6.1 HTTPS Only
- [ ] All API calls use HTTPS
- [ ] No HTTP fallbacks
- [ ] Certificate pinning (optional but recommended)

#### 6.2 Data Transmission
- [ ] Document what data is sent where
- [ ] AI queries go to respective providers (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI)
- [ ] License verification goes to Supabase
- [ ] No other data transmission to MobileCLI servers

### 7. Permission Justification

Document why each dangerous permission is needed:

| Permission | Justification |
|------------|---------------|
| CAMERA | termux-camera-photo command |
| RECORD_AUDIO | termux-microphone-record command |
| READ_SMS | termux-sms-list command |
| SEND_SMS | termux-sms-send command |
| READ_CONTACTS | termux-contact-list command |
| ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION | termux-location command |
| READ_CALL_LOG | termux-call-log command |
| CALL_PHONE | termux-telephony-call command |
| ... | ... |

### 8. Third-Party Dependencies

#### 8.1 Audit Dependencies
- [ ] Review all Gradle dependencies
- [ ] Check for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Update outdated dependencies

#### 8.2 Terminal Libraries
- terminal-view: Apache 2.0 ✓
- terminal-emulator: Apache 2.0 ✓
- No known vulnerabilities

### 9. User Data Protection

#### 9.1 Local Storage
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] License keys stored securely
- [ ] API tokens use Android Keystore

#### 9.2 Clear Data on Uninstall
- [ ] No residual files in external storage
- [ ] User notified about ~/home directory contents
