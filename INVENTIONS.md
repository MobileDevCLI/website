### 3. AAA-Quality AI Game Development Method

**Status**: Methodology Proven - Documentation Needed
**First Demonstrated**: Vibe Jam 2025
**Evidence**: Hundreds of video games built on PC

**What It Is**:
Methodology for creating professional-quality 3D games using AI, by combining AI-generated logic with professional assets instead of accepting basic AI-generated shapes and textures.

**Key Insight**:
AI by default generates basic geometric shapes and placeholder assets. The methodology is to:
1. Use AI for game logic, physics, interaction code
2. Source professional assets (Three.js geometries, shader effects, professional textures)
3. Combine for AAA-quality output vs amateur-looking AI output

**Key Components**:
1. AI for code generation and logic
2. Professional asset sourcing (Three.js, Cannon.js, shader libraries)
3. GPU-optimized rendering (WebGL, shader-based effects)
4. Mobile-first optimization (30fps minimum target)
5. Verification loop (visual testing, iteration)

**Why It Matters**:
- Standard AI output = basic shapes, amateur quality
- This methodology = professional-quality games
- Difference between prototype and shippable product

**Evidence**:
- 17 WebGL demos on mobilecli.com
- Hundreds of PC games built previously
- Vibe Jam 2025 participation
- First to livestream Godot + Cursor workflow

**Documentation**:
- CLAUDE.md - Quality Standards section
- CLAUDE.md - WebGL Best Practices
- demos.html - 17 working examples
- pro-preview.html - Inspiration Gallery tab

**IP Status**:
- Needs formal documentation
- Methodology proven but not yet specified in detail

**Key Components**:
1. Godot project structure
2. Cursor AI integration
3. GDScript generation
4. Real-time iteration workflow

**Why It's Novel**:
- First person to livestream this workflow
- Demonstrated before widespread adoption

**Documentation**:

## Methodology Patterns (Reusable Concepts)

### Pattern A: AI Orchestration

**Used In**: AI Robotics, MobileCLI
**Concept**: AI focuses on decision-making, delegates compute-heavy tasks to specialized models

```
Don't do this: AI does everything (slow, bottlenecked)
Do this: AI orchestrates specialized tools (fast, scalable)
```

### Pattern B: Zero-Compute Client

**Used In**: MobileCLI
**Concept**: Device does zero AI computation. All processing happens on remote servers. Device is thin client.

**Implications**:
- Minimal battery usage
- No heat generation
- Speed matches any workstation
- $200 phone = $3000 MacBook

### Pattern C: Knowledge Compounding

**Used In**: MobileCLI (CLAUDE.md system)
**Concept**: AI learns from documentation checked into the repo. Knowledge accumulates across sessions.

**How It Works**:
1. Check CLAUDE.md into git
2. AI reads it on each session
3. When AI makes mistake, add to CLAUDE.md
4. AI never makes same mistake again

### Pattern D: Three-Layer Persistence

**Used In**: MobileCLI
**Concept**: Mobile sessions require three layers to survive:
1. CPU Persistence (prevent sleep)
2. Session Survival (survive backgrounding)
3. Autonomous Operation (no approval prompts)

**Discovery**: Each layer alone fails. Combined, sessions run 72+ hours.

### Pattern E: Dual-Channel Operation

**Used In**: AI Robotics
**Concept**: Separate channels for control (outbound) and feedback (inbound).

```
Control: AI → TX → RX → Robot
Video: Camera → TX → RX → AI Analysis
```

### Pattern F: Verification Loop

**Used In**: All inventions
**Concept**: AI with feedback loop produces 2-3x quality improvement.

**Boris Cherny Quote**: "The most important thing to get great results: give Claude a way to verify its work."
