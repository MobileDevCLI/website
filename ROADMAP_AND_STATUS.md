## 5. Stripe Setup Instructions

### File to Update
`website/js/stripe-config.js`

### Current State (needs updating):
```javascript
const STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'pk_test_YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY';  // CHANGE THIS

const STRIPE_PRICES = {
    pro_monthly: 'price_YOUR_PRO_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID',      // CHANGE THIS
    pro_yearly: 'price_YOUR_PRO_YEARLY_PRICE_ID',        // CHANGE THIS
    team_monthly: 'price_YOUR_TEAM_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID',    // CHANGE THIS
    team_yearly: 'price_YOUR_TEAM_YEARLY_PRICE_ID'       // CHANGE THIS
};
```

### After You Create Stripe Products:
Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys from Stripe Dashboard.

### Stripe Webhook Setup
1. In Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://mwxlguqukyfberyhtkmg.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
3. Select events:
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.paid`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
4. Copy webhook signing secret
5. Add to Supabase Edge Function secrets

---

## 6. Security Concerns

### CRITICAL: Personal Data Removal

Before public release, audit for:

1. **Conversation History**
   - Any AI chat logs embedded in code
   - Comments referencing personal conversations
   - Debug logs with personal info

2. **Personal Identifiers**
   - Email addresses
   - Phone numbers
   - Physical addresses
   - Social media handles
   - Real names

3. **File Paths**
   - `C:\Users\slodo\...` → Should be relative paths
   - Any absolute paths with usernames

4. **API Keys & Secrets**
   - Supabase service key (NOT anon key - anon is public)
   - Stripe secret key
   - Any OAuth client secrets

5. **Git History**
   - May contain sensitive data from past commits
   - Consider: `git filter-branch` to clean history
   - Or: Start fresh repo for public release

### App Security Model

MobileCLI is intentionally powerful (79 permissions). This is a feature, not a bug. But users must understand:

1. **User Consent:** Setup Wizard requires explicit agreement
2. **Local Processing:** No data sent to MobileCLI servers
3. **AI Provider Data:** Queries go to Anthropic/Google/OpenAI
4. **Permission Scope:** Users grant permissions knowingly

### Recommendations

1. Add security disclosure page to website
2. Document all permissions and why they're needed
3. Consider penetration testing before major launch
4. Set up bug bounty program after launch
