## THE INVENTION

### What IS the Invention (Proprietary IP):
1. **Mobile Phone as Development Environment** - Using Android/iOS phones as complete coding workstations
2. **Linux Layer on Mobile** - Termux (Android) or iSH/a-Shell (iOS) providing full CLI access
3. **AI CLI as Primary Interface** - Claude Code as the development interface, not a traditional IDE
4. **Autonomous 24+ Hour Sessions** - Phone running development sessions overnight while sleeping
5. **CLAUDE.md Knowledge Compounding** - Documentation file that accumulates AI knowledge across sessions
6. **Dual-Repository Deployment** - Synchronized source and deployment repos pushed from mobile
7. **Platform-Agnostic Method** - Works on any phone with Linux layer + AI CLI

### What is NOT Part of the Invention:
- General productivity tips for using AI tools (publicly available)
- The underlying technologies themselves (Termux, Claude Code, Git, etc.)
- The specific website code (released under MIT License)
- Third-party techniques or workflows
