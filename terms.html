            <h3>13.1 Binding Arbitration</h3>
            <p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, or validity thereof shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.

            <p>Unless both you and MobileDevCLI agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>

            <h2>15. Modifications</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms. Material changes will be announced on our website. We will provide at least 30 days' notice for material changes by posting a notice on the Service or sending you an email.</p>

            <h2>16. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to our services at any time, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these terms or is harmful to other users or us. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. All provisions which by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

            <h2>17. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
            <p>For any disputes not subject to arbitration, you agree that any legal action or proceeding shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Delaware, and you hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>

            <h2>18. International Users</h2>

            <h2>19. Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, or if modification is not possible, shall be severed, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

            <h2>20. Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, Disclaimer, and Intellectual Property Notice, constitute the entire agreement between you and MobileDevCLI regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.</p>

            <h2>21. No Waiver</h2>
            <p>Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such provision or any other provision. No waiver shall be effective unless in writing and signed by MobileDevCLI.</p>

            <h2>22. Assignment</h2>
            <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder without our prior written consent. MobileDevCLI may assign these Terms without restriction.
